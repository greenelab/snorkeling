prostate cancer	DKK1	conclusion : high ~~[[2 dkk-1 2]]~~ serum levels are associated with a poor survival in patients with ~~[[1 prostate cancer 1]]~~ .	0.999	0.916
breast cancer	ERBB2	conclusion : ~~[[2 her-2 / neu 2]]~~ overexpression in primary ~~[[1 breast carcinoma 1]]~~ is correlated with patients ' age ( under age 50 ) and calcifications at mammography .	0.998	0.906
breast cancer	ERBB2	the results of multiple linear regression analysis , with her2 as the dependent variable , showed that family history of ~~[[1 breast cancer 1]]~~ was significantly associated with elevated ~~[[2 her2 2]]~~ levels in the tumors ( p = 0.0038 ) , after controlling for the effects of age , tumor estrogen receptor , and dna index .	0.998	0.904
colon cancer	SP3	ba also decreased expression of sp1 , ~~[[2 sp3 2]]~~ and sp4 transcription factors which are overexpressed in ~~[[1 colon cancer 1]]~~ cells and decreased levels of several sp-regulated genes including survivin , vascular endothelial growth factor , p65 sub-unit of nfkb , epidermal growth factor receptor , cyclin d1 , and pituitary tumor transforming gene-1 .	0.998	0.902
breast cancer	ERBB2	in ~~[[1 breast cancer 1]]~~ , overexpression of ~~[[2 her2 2]]~~ is associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis .	0.998	0.898
breast cancer	BCL2	in clinical ~~[[1 breast cancer 1]]~~ samples , high ~~[[2 bcl2 2]]~~ expression was associated with poor prognosis .	0.997	0.886
adrenal gland cancer	TP53	the mechanisms of adrenal tumorigenesis remain poorly established ; the r337h germline mutation in the ~~[[2 p53 2]]~~ gene has previously been associated with ~~[[1 acts 1]]~~ in brazilian children .	0.996	0.883
prostate cancer	AR	the ~~[[2 androgen receptor 2]]~~ was expressed in all primary and metastatic ~~[[1 prostate cancer 1]]~~ tissues and no mutations were identified .	0.996	0.881
urinary bladder cancer	PIK3CA	conclusions : increased levels of fgfr3 and ~~[[2 pik3ca 2]]~~ mutated dna in urine and plasma are indicative of later progression and metastasis in ~~[[1 bladder cancer 1]]~~ .	0.995	0.866
ovarian cancer	EPAS1	the log-rank test showed that nuclear positive immunostaining for hif-1alpha ( p = .002 ) and cytoplasmic positive immunostaining for ~~[[2 hif-2alpha 2]]~~ ( p = .0112 ) in tumor cells are associated with poor prognosis of patients with ~~[[1 ovarian carcinoma 1]]~~ .	0.994	0.86
