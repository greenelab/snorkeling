GiG	BRCA2	BRCA1	0.972	0.984	12257	Novel	a total of 9 families ( 16 % ) showed mutations in the ~~[[2 brca1 2]]~~ gene , including the one new mutation identified in this study ( 5382insc ) , and 12 families ( 21 % ) presented mutations in the ~~[[1 brca2 1]]~~ gene .
GiG	MDM2	TP53	0.938	0.978	17128	Existing	no mutations in the ~~[[2 tp53 2]]~~ gene have been found in samples with amplification of ~~[[1 mdm2 1]]~~ .
GiG	BRCA1	BRCA2	1	0.978	12257	Existing	pathogenic truncating mutations in the ~~[[1 brca1 1]]~~ gene were found in two tumor samples with allelic losses , whereas no mutations were identified in the ~~[[2 brca2 2]]~~ gene .
GiG	KRAS	TP53	0.992	0.971	4106	Novel	mutations in the ~~[[2 p53 2]]~~ gene did not correlate with mutations in the ~~[[1 c-k-ras 1]]~~ gene , indicating that colorectal cancer can develop through pathways independent not only of the presence of mutations in any of these genes but also of their cooperation .
GiG	TP53	HRAS	0.992	0.969	451	Novel	pathologic examination of the uc specimens from aa-exposed patients identified heterozygous ~~[[2 hras 2]]~~ changes in 3 cases , and deletion or replacement mutations in the ~~[[1 tp53 1]]~~ gene in 4 .
GiG	REN	NR1H3	0.998	0.966	8	Novel	nuclear receptor ~~[[2 lxralpha 2]]~~ is involved in camp-mediated human ~~[[1 renin 1]]~~ gene expression .
GiG	ESR2	CYP19A1	0.999	0.96	159	Novel	dna methylation , histone modifications , and binding of estrogen receptor , ~~[[1 erb 1]]~~ to regulatory dna sequences of ~~[[2 cyp19a1 2]]~~ gene were evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) assay .
GiG	RET	EDNRB	0.816	0.96	136	Novel	mutations in the ~~[[1 ret 1]]~~ gene , which codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase , and in ~~[[2 ednrb 2]]~~ which codes for the endothelin-b receptor , have been shown to be associated with hscr in humans .
GiG	PKD1	PKD2	1	0.959	1614	Existing	approximately 85 % of adpkd cases are caused by mutations in the ~~[[1 pkd1 1]]~~ gene , while mutations in the ~~[[2 pkd2 2]]~~ gene account for the remaining 15 % of cases .
GiG	LYZ	CTCF	0.999	0.959	2	Novel	in conjunction with the thyroid receptor ( tr ) , ~~[[2 ctcf 2]]~~ binding to the ~~[[1 lysozyme 1]]~~ gene transcriptional silencer mediates the thyroid hormone response element ( tre ) - dependent transcriptional repression .
