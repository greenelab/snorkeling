Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate	B3GNT2	in sk-n-mc human neuroblastoma cells , the ~~[[1 camp 1]]~~ response to 10 nm isoproterenol ( iso ) is mediated primarily by ~~[[2 beta 1-adrenergic 2]]~~ receptors .	0.903	0.93	1.0
Indomethacin	AGT	~~[[1 indomethacin 1]]~~ , a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis , is known to increase the maternal blood pressure response to ~~[[2 angiotensin ii 2]]~~ infusion .	0.894	0.922	0.0
Tretinoin	RXRA	the vitamin a derivative ~~[[1 retinoic acid 1]]~~ exerts its effects on transcription through two distinct classes of nuclear receptors , the retinoic acid receptor ( rar ) and the ~~[[2 retinoid x receptor 2]]~~ ( rxr ) .	0.882	0.912	1.0
Tretinoin	RXRA	the vitamin a derivative retinoic acid exerts its effects on transcription through two distinct classes of nuclear receptors , the ~~[[1 retinoic acid 1]]~~ receptor ( rar ) and the ~~[[2 retinoid x receptor 2]]~~ ( rxr ) .	0.872	0.903	0.0
D-Tyrosine	CSF1	however , the extent of gap ~~[[1 tyrosine 1]]~~ phosphorylation induced by ~~[[2 csf-1 2]]~~ was approximately 10 % of that induced by pdgf-bb in the nih3t3 fibroblasts .	0.851	0.883	1.0
D-Glutamic Acid	GLB1	thus , the negatively charged side chain of ~~[[1 glu-461 1]]~~ is important for divalent cation binding to ~~[[2 beta-galactosidase 2]]~~ .	0.849	0.882	0.0
D-Tyrosine	CD4	second , we use the same system to provide evidence that the physical association of ~~[[2 cd4 2]]~~ with the tcr is required for effective ~~[[1 tyrosine 1]]~~ phosphorylation of the tcr zeta-chain subunit , presumably reflecting delivery of p56lck ( lck ) to the tcr .	0.825	0.859	1.0
Calcium Chloride	TNC	the possibility that the enhanced length dependence of ~~[[1 ca2 1]]~~ + sensitivity after cardiac tnc reconstitution was attributable to reduced ~~[[2 tnc 2]]~~ binding was excluded when the length dependence of partially extracted fast fibres was reduced to one-half the normal value after a 50 % deletion of the native tnc .	0.821	0.855	0.0
Metoprolol	KCNMB2	studies in difi cells of the displacement of specific 125i-cyp binding by nonselective ( propranolol ) , beta 1-selective ( ~~[[1 metoprolol 1]]~~ and atenolol ) , and beta 2-selective ( ici 118-551 ) antagonists revealed only a single class of ~~[[2 beta 2-adrenergic 2]]~~ receptors .	0.82	0.854	0.0
D-Tyrosine	PLCG1	epidermal growth factor ( egf ) or platelet-derived growth factor binding to their receptor on fibroblasts induces tyrosine phosphorylation of plc gamma 1 and stable association of ~~[[2 plc gamma 1 2]]~~ with the receptor protein ~~[[1 tyrosine 1]]~~ kinase .	0.818	0.851	0.0
